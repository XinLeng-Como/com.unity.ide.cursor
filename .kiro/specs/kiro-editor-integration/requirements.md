# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves adapting the existing Unity Cursor editor integration package to work with Kiro instead of Cursor. The package currently provides auto-discovery of Cursor installations, C# project file generation, and Unity external editor integration. We need to modify it to detect and integrate with Kiro installations while maintaining all the core functionality that makes Unity development seamless.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Unity developer using Kiro, I want the package to automatically detect my Kiro installation, so that I can seamlessly open Unity projects in Kiro without manual configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Unity starts THEN the system SHALL scan for Kiro installations on Windows, macOS, and Linux
2. WHEN multiple Kiro installations are found THEN the system SHALL prioritize the most recent version
3. WHEN no Kiro installation is found THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message to the user
4. WHEN Kiro is installed after Unity startup THEN the system SHALL detect it on next Unity restart

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Unity developer, I want the package to generate proper C# project files for Kiro, so that I get full IntelliSense support and code navigation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Unity project is opened THEN the system SHALL generate .csproj files compatible with Kiro
2. WHEN project structure changes THEN the system SHALL automatically regenerate project files
3. WHEN assembly definitions are modified THEN the system SHALL update corresponding project references
4. WHEN Unity packages are added or removed THEN the system SHALL update package references in project files

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Unity developer, I want to open scripts and projects in Kiro directly from Unity, so that I can maintain my development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I double-click a script in Unity THEN the system SHALL open it in Kiro at the correct line
2. WHEN I select "Open C# Project" in Unity THEN the system SHALL open the entire project in Kiro
3. WHEN opening files THEN the system SHALL ensure Kiro workspace is properly configured
4. WHEN Kiro is not running THEN the system SHALL launch Kiro automatically

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Unity developer, I want the package to work across all supported platforms, so that my team can use Kiro regardless of their operating system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running on Windows THEN the system SHALL detect Kiro installations in standard Windows locations
2. WHEN running on macOS THEN the system SHALL detect Kiro installations in Applications and user directories
3. WHEN running on Linux THEN the system SHALL detect Kiro installations in standard Linux paths
4. WHEN platform-specific features are needed THEN the system SHALL use appropriate conditional compilation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Unity developer, I want the package to maintain compatibility with Unity's debugging features, so that I can debug my code through Visual Studio Tools for Unity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN debugging is enabled THEN the system SHALL maintain VSTU compatibility
2. WHEN breakpoints are set THEN the system SHALL ensure proper debugging integration
3. WHEN debugging sessions start THEN the system SHALL coordinate between Unity and the debugging tools
4. WHEN debugging features are used THEN the system SHALL not interfere with existing Unity debugging workflows

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a Unity developer, I want the package to be properly identified and versioned, so that I can manage it through Unity Package Manager.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the package is installed THEN the system SHALL display "Kiro Editor" as the package name
2. WHEN viewing package details THEN the system SHALL show correct version information
3. WHEN updating the package THEN the system SHALL handle version migrations properly
4. WHEN the package is listed THEN the system SHALL use the identifier "com.como.ide.kiro"
